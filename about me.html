<p style="color:#4863A0;"><b>I AM ZALME P. TAGAILO. 18 YEARS OF AGE, BORN ON FEBRUARY 18, 2004, A AQUARIUS. 
BORN IN LAPU-LAPU CITY, CEBU. CURRENTLY I LIVE IN SEVILLA, BOHOL.
NOT AN INTROVER, BUT NOT ALOS AN EXTROVERT, I'M IN BETWEEN. I LIKE CATS MORE 
THAN PEOPLE. MUSIC IS MY THERAPY WHEN EVERYTHING IS DRAINING. I LET THINGS BE FOR 
THEIR OWN SANITY.</b></p>

<p style="color:#4863A0;"><b>MY GUIDING PRINCIPLE IN LIFE IS TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE MOMENTS. LIVING MY LIFE IS 
ALWAYS TRUE TO MYSELF. IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE TO LIVE YOUR LIFE WITH INTREGITY, AND 
IT'S A LOT EASIER WHEN YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF GUIDING PRINCIPLE. YOU CAN ALWAYS LOOK 
BACK TO YOUR ACTIONS AND CHOICES.</b></p>

<p style="color:#4863A0;"><b>I AM NOT DIFFERENT FROM OTHERS, I DO THINGS THAT THEY ALSO DO. I MAKE MISTAKES, BUT I 
LEAREND FROM THOSE MISTAKES.</b></p>

<p style="color:#4863A0;"><b>I DON'T HAVE SO MUCH ACCOMPLISHMENT YET AT MY AGE. BUT BEING INDEPENDENT AT YOUNG AGE 
IS ONE OF MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND TO BE ABLE TO WAKE UP EVERY DAY. I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE 
ALREADY MADE MY PARENTS PROUD. THEY SAID THEY'RE ALREADY OF WHAT I AM RIGHT NOW, BUT FOR 
ME THAT ISN'T ENOUGH. SOON I CAN MAKE THEM BE MORE PROUD OF ME.</b></p>

<p style="color:#4863A0;"><b>MY PLANS IN THE FUTURE ARE TO MAKE MY PARENTS EVEN PROUD OF ME AND TO BE SUCCESSFUL, SO 
THAT I CAN RETURN WHAT THEY GAVE TO ME. BUT SOMETIMES WE ARE SO FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE THAT 
WE DON'T REALISE THAT TODAY WAS WHAT WE WERE PRAYING FOR.</b></p>
